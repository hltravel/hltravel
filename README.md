- ï¿½Pls help Prolog home work
- ðŸ‘€Hello it is my home work but I cant do it who can help me :(
In the knowledge base there is information about age and population of capitals:
Estonia, +372, Tallinn, 1154, 444532
Latvia, +371, Riga, 1201, 614618
Lithuania, +370, Vilnius, 1323, 588412

Task 1 is to describe a predicate for consultation with this base to get exactly the same list.
2nd task is to extend this predicate to get countries only with capitals older than a specified age, or where live more than a specified count of people.
